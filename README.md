# Dog-Breed-Classifier-Project

### Project Overview

Breed classifier is a well-known Machine Learning Problem, The problem consist of identifying the breed of dogs if dog image is given as input, if we supply image of a human then we have to identify the resembling dog breed. We have to build a model that can process real world user supplied images and identify an estimate of the canine’s breed. This is a multi-class classification problem where we can use supervised machine learning to solve this problem.
